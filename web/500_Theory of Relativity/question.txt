Theory of Relativity
Part two(The Interpreter) may be harder than this one.

Here is a bytecode interpreter. It executes your program and shows the output. In fact, I prepared this to run an event named "slowest program wins!" A program with longest elapsed time wins a gift. That's all.

There's a timeout (14s maybe?). However, if your program executes longer than **100 seconds**, you win the flag!

For your information, the server is Ubuntu 16.04.3 with node.js 8.9.1.
