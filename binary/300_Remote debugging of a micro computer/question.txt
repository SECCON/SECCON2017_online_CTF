Remote debugging of a micro computer

Connect to the server and read "word.txt" on current directory.
$ echo '$g#67+' | nc micro.pwn.seccon.jp 10000

The server is running on GDB simulator with special patches.
Long time connection will be disconnected automatically. (in several minutes)
Short interval requests will be also ignored. (in several seconds)
